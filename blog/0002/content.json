'final hours', 'song of healing' and 'stone tower temple'. the whole soundtrack has this melancholic, ethereal quality that i've always tried to emulate throughout my musical endeavors.

"},{"index":6,"type":"text","contents":"my nirvana phase was utter insanity. i was obsessed with kurt to the point that i - and trust me, my younger self would hat eme for writing this out right now, becuase i was in such denial - wanted to be kurt cobain. i had my hair cut like him, i learned all the nirvana songs, whenever someone said i looked like him it made me so, so happy. it was to the point that i even hated my eye color, because it wasn't blue like kurt's. i don' tknow why i idolized a relatively talented junkie for so long, but teenage obsessions are bizarre to say the least. i don't think lowly of kurt, really, nor nirvana. what they were able to achieve in such a short time is incredibly impressive, and i think as a songwriter, kurt cobain was a real talent. it's a shame what happened to him. i still don't know what to think, really. most likely the conspiracy surrounding his death spawned from misogyny, which shouldn't really go unnoticed as quite a cruel irony. people will think what they will."},{"index":7,"type":"pic","contents":"3d288473-705b-4653-af35-e2403f68a48b.png"},{"index":8,"type":"text","contents":"well would ya look at that, it's a baby static playing a fender (squier) jaguar, just like kurt's. shocker."},{"index":9,"type":"text","contents":"not long after my KC phase, i started getting real into sonic youth. i would still consider myself in my 'sonic youth phase', lol...<br>something about that band just fills me with so much emotion. and i think that'll last, a long long time. it hasn't stopped yet... you heard my thoughts earlier, or at least a small fraction of them, so i'll spare you more details. other than the following..."},{"index":10,"type":"text","contents":"i got into sonic youth because of nirvana, funnily enough. i watched an interview with kurt cobain, he said 'it's an honor to be touring with such amazing bands that we've followed for years - dino jr., sonic youth...' and i thought to myself, i guess i should check those guys out. never got overly into dino jr., but something about SY just clicked for me. their use of weird tunings, the chords they form, their whole aesthetic is just perfect to me. in terms of my influences, they're the biggest in terms of band music, by all means."},{"index":11,"type":"text","contents":"moving on... sonic youth branched out to pretty much everyone influenced by them - mbv, slowdive, cocteau twins, women/preoccupations, radiohead (had a big ol' radiohead phase, yeah, we'll get to that, in another blog, maybe...), sun kil moon, duster, elliott smith (a recent favorite), nine inch nails (there's that industrialism), m83, deerhunter, have a nice life, black midi, black country new road, blemishes, melvins, swans... and so many others. but i know what you're thinking - 'why don't you shut the fuck up about yourself for one second, you narcissistic bitch?' - and to that i say, no thanks, this is MY blog!!!!!11"},{"index":12,"type":"text","contents":"you may also be thinking, 'where's the electronic influence?' so let's talk a little bit about that"},{"index":13,"type":"text","contents":"i used to be very big into 'meme' and 'shitposting' communities across facebook - i'm talking about real shitposting too, as in, posting text to a page. i could talk at length about this but i'd rather not. today's subject is music. anyways, i remember within these circles there was a lot of 'in-jokes' surrounding vaporwave - artists like st. pepsi, floral shoppe, blank banshee - the pioneers of the genre. when listening to it at first i thought it was bizarre but relatively endearing, and i liked that it kind of just spawned from shitposting and satire. in a similar vein, a lot of jokes were made about death grips as well. from vaporwave and death grips, i learned to absolutely love electronica."},{"index":14,"type":"text","contents":"i think the first electronic album to really mean something to me was - and this was one of my first bandcamp purchases, ever - randy goffe/HOME's 'odyssey'. to this day this album - and randy goffe's music, in general - has shaped my approach to synthesis a considerable amount. i still love this album. i find the lush chords and rich synths to be entirely endearing. the fact that i can now create music not dissimilar (though nowhere near comprable in quality) to his own is a dream come true, really. of course, he's mainly known for 'resonance', which is also a great track, but... all of his work deserves recognition."},{"index":15,"type":"text","contents":"let's see, thereafter i started getting very into death grips and 2814... 2814's 'birth of a new day' remains one of my top albums of all time. i've had many a panic attack circumvented purely by the opening track to that album. its influence on my approach to electronic music is, too, undeniable. i'd encourage anyone who has yet to listen through that masterpiece to do so now, or at the very least, as soon as possible. you're wasting your time by not listening to it. anyways, death grips was by all means an obsession, and youtube recommendations eventually led me to machine girl, who i also obsessed over for a while. i wasn't big on jungle and dnb - in fact, i say this often, if my 15 year old self knew i was making weeb-ass breakcore bullshit i'd probably have killed myself (lol). i operated under the classic guise of, 'it all sounds the same! just like rap and metal!' which was foolish. it's not for everyone, i understand that, but wow, is it for me. i would say death grips and machine girl opened the doors to me for more hardcore electronic music, and steered me a little away from ambient electronic music - that's not to say i didn't still very much enjoy ambient, it's an intrinsic aspect of my taste, if you couldn't tell from my songs - but they showed me electronic music had so much more to offer."},{"index":16,"type":"text","contents":"in very late 2019, going into early 2020, a video got recommended to me under the title 'mr. kill myself'. by an artist known then as 'sewerslvt'."},{"index":17,"type":"text","contents":"i will not speak much on this artist considering the controversy she's found herself in. what i will say is that her music has had an undeniably large influence on jungle/ambient/breakcore music on the whole, and inspired a new generation of such artists to start creating. and her music has also been one of my biggest inspirations across all music projects i've ever worked on, in some way or another."},{"index":18,"type":"text","contents":"i will also say, as a transgender artist, to see another transgender artist create music that was so beautiful to me, and to be at the stage she was at in terms of popularity -
