i like this track, although i don't like it quite as much as 'siflae' or 'tpcs'. it was a fun track to work on, and one of the first where i really got my bearings designing synthesizers in 'vital'. i actually know a fair amount about synthesis design, i took a module on it back at university, and it was one of my favorite classes by far that semester. to be able to exercise my knowledge from that aspect of my course within this music is a lot of fun. 
my friend franco helped me with the art by stretching the top left corner - in the original image it was a little weirdly laid out because this came from another laserdisc boxset insert, and i'd accidentally gotten some of my bed in the shot. so thanks, franco.
i love how the colors came across in this picture."}]}
