yes, sometimes i do. what does that mean? well, what is an executable? i'll let you think about that, i'd rather not spell it out for you, but if you don't get it, maybe go read the lyrics to the main track and b-side. they're available on my bandcamp.
i love this cover. i think it's so pretty, it looks very... water-colory. the streaks of rust and moss come through and contrast the deep purples and blues so well. it's another cover that i feel very well matches the track to which it's pertained.
