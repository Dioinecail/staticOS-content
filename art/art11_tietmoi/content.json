'Tiet Moi' is a track i love a lot. it's not breakcore, no, it's downtempo, and my main inspirations were Aphex Twin and Boards of Canada, two of my favorite artists, period. if you haven't heard them i recommend checking them out, by all means. for BoC i recommend 'campfire headspace', 'music has the right to children' and 'geogaddi'. for aphex, 'selected ambient works, vol. 1', '...i care because you do' and 'syro'. 'drukqs' is also fantastic. this was a fun one to craft. i like how it came together. i like even more the music video that came with it, created by Alexis B., an old and dear friend of mine. "}]}
