this was my first real dabble into true electronic music. i'd done some vapor/synthwave in the past, and certainly some of my prior ventures had electronic influence at times, but this was the first time i'd properly done anything truly electronic. a house track! with some nice piano chords i plonked out while improvising.
this is also the first single off my EP, 'statc.grl'.
the cover is a lot of stuff spliced together. i won't go into detail, but if you look close enough, maybe you'll find something cool. something you might find out in the wild. eyes peeled n all that."}]}
